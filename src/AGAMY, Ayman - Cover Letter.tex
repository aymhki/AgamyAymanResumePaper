    Dear Hiring Team,

    \vspace{1em}
    \noindent
    I am writing to submit my candidature for the casual pool at the University of Manitoba. Through both academia and professional experience, I have become familiar with many of the technologies employed by your diverse team of professionals. I am keenly interested in working for the University of Manitoba because it has been a nurturing ground for my personal and professional growth. The welcoming community and the opportunities I’ve been given have shaped me into the person I am today.

    \vspace{1em}
    \noindent
    I am confident that my experience aligns well with the requirements for this role because I have gained proficiency in MS Office Suite, data entry, accounting, and web development throughout the last five years. As a fresh graduate with a degree in Computer Science, many of these qualifications come naturally as part of the main assessments in the core courses I took at the U of M. From the data science and statistics courses that taught me how to create, process, and present information in various formats to the computer science courses that helped me ship and publish websites and applications for real users. Moreover, my work in various service positions has polished my clerical and accounting skills to a practical and real-world experience level. For example, my most recent position as a Live Operations Specialist at JustEat Takeaway involved data entry in production spreadsheets, accounting in internal portal tools, and support ticket management in live calls and chats. Finally, I retain excellent written and oral communication skills, which I believe are essential for working effectively in any clerical or secretarial positions.

    %  Beyond my technical skills, I am a strong collaborator and enjoy being involved in helpful activities in my environment as much as I can. For instance, I have been volunteering as a Computer Science tutor for students at the University of Manitoba for over two years, and I still love helping students overcome challenging assignments and exams. 

    \vspace{1em}
    \noindent
    I am particularly drawn to U of M's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion across its campuses. Your emphasis on these principles resonates with my career aspirations and personal values. 

    \vspace{1em}
    \noindent
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
